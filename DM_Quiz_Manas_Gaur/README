3. Support Vector Machine classifier is in "Quiz_DM_SVM_classifier.py" with its Pickle (.pkl) is in the folder PKL_file_classifier with the name "trained_SVM_classifier.pkl".

4. In order to execute the python code "Quiz_DM_LogR_classifier.py" and "Quiz_DM_SVM_classifier.py", make changes in the "PATH" of the twitter text files.
